# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project is meant to be an analytical examination of statistics on the successes and failures of Kickstarter campaigns.

### Purpose
The purpose is to aggregate statistics from the successes, failures, and canceled campaigns, and to illustrate those statistics in order to gain insight on which factors drive said outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
An analysis was performed on the outcomes. First, I used pivot tables to isolate different slices of the data in order to determine what effects details such as campaign launch dates and donation goals had on the outcome of their respective campaigns. I also aggregated data based on central tendency and spread, and tabulated totals of successes, failures, and cancellations by goal category. Lastly, I created several charts in order to serve as examples and to help visualize the meaning of the aggregated data (see below).

Outcomes based on donation goals:

Theater category outcomes based on launch date:

No serious challenges were encountered, but potential challenges include deciding how to efficiently weigh factors that do not directly correlate and determining whether an outlier is meaningful or if it is more of an indication of an error in the data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The months of May and June seem to produce more successful campaigns than other months out of the year. However, those months also seem to produce many failed campaigns as well, with May in particular producing more than any other month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The vast majority of projects specify a donation goal of less than $5,000, and these projects also have the highest likelihood to be successful. This is most likely correlated to the fact that the bar for success is set very low compared to higher donation goals. In fact, the percentage of failed campaigns trends up as the donation goal increases, with the exception of the $35,000 to $39,999 and $40,000 to $44,999 ranges which would be considered outliers.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is very limited beyond what you can determine from donation goals, donations achieved, and start/end dates for each campaign. While observations can be made about success and failure totals for each month, there really is not much insight one can extract from this as to what the underlying cause is for these outcomes and the correlation there is, if any, to time of year and launch date. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some examples could be showing success and failure rates for each parent category of campaign, success and failure rates by year, and success and failure rates of staff picks.
